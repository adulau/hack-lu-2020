General Guidelines
------------------

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

All participants at Hack.lu are required to adhere to this Code of Conduct. The term “participant(s)” includes all attendees, organizers, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and other invited guests for the duration of the event.

Hack.lu is dedicated to providing a positive and safe event for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, economic status, OS choices, text editor or scripting language preferences.

In order to create a fun and safe environment for everyone, Hack.lu does not tolerate any form of unacceptable behavior, including (but not limited to) harassment.

Apart from the infrastructure specifically put in place for that purpose during the CTF competition, any use of the facilities in place (physical and logical) to hack or commit illegal acts is strictly forbidden.

Hack.lu’s Values & Expected Behavior
------------------------------------

Be friendly and welcoming
=========================

Hack.lu is volunteer-run, hosted by infosec professionals spending countless hours of their free time to
create a fun and unique experience for all. We all want to have a good time and share this friendly and welcoming ambiance.

Be patient & pedagogic.
=======================

Remember that people are here to learn and have fun. Not everyone has the same skillset, background or native language.
Productive communication requires effort: think about how your words will be interpreted, and think about how others' words were intended.

Be respectful & collaborative.
==============================

In particular, respect differences of opinion and differences between people.

Do also consider that FluxFingers have expended a great deal of effort in creating CTF challenges.
Although all efforts are made to minimize bugs, understand that any errors you think you’ve found in a specific challenge were made in good faith.

Be responsible.
===============

Alcohol is be served at Hack.lu, so please drink responsibly and judge your personal capacity with care. Organizers have a right to refuse to serve alcohol to anyone, for any reason, at their sole discretion. If you encounter someone who is intoxicated, and you believe they need support or intervention, let an organizer know. Hack.lu reminds you that driving while intoxicated is a criminal offense in Luxembourg. If you need to arrange transportation, we can assist you in locating a taxi or help you to navigate public transportation.

It is important to note that possessing any illegal substance, including but not limited to narcotics, marijuana, or other illegal drugs and that smoking (or vaping) – other than in designated areas is strictly prohibited and falls under unacceptable behavior policy.

Unacceptable Behavior Policy
============================

Hack.lu expects all participants to refrain from engaging in unlawful activity while attending the conference
and to conduct themselves with respect for others at all times.

The following behaviours are considered unacceptable at Hack.lu:

* Physically or logically attacking any part of Hack.lu’s infrastructure;
* Physically or logically attacking any devices or tools, belonging to other Hack.lu participants;
* Physically or logically attacking third party software, services or infrastructure upon which Hack.lu relies (including property of the venue/hotel);
* Breaking the rules set forth during the CTF competition. For instance, not respecting the time limits imposed for some CTF challenges, and not complying immediately when asked by organizers to stop trying to solve the challenge.
* Publishing sensitive, personal and/or private information regarding any participant without that participant’s explicit consent;
* Publishing intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning materials about any participant;
* Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct toward any other participant;
* Offensive, discriminatory or inappropriate comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion;
* Offensive, discriminatory or inappropriate comments regarding a person’s lifestyle and personal practices, including those related to food, health, relationships, parenting, drugs, or employment.
* Gratuitous, unwelcome or off-topic violent or sexual imagery or behaviour. Participants are reminded that children are sometimes present at Hack.lu events.
* Sexual attention, remarks, gestures or physical contact in the absence of active and affirmative consent. Participants are reminded that under Luxemburgish law, any sexual contact (including touching and kissing) without affirmative consent — either through words or unambiguous conduct — is considered sexual assault. Neither silence nor passivity is sufficient to demonstrate consent under Luxemburgish law. In other words, only yes means yes.
* Intimidation, stalking or following, threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual or group;
* Inappropriate social contact, such as continuing to make attempts to communicate with someone after they have indicated that they do not wish to speak to you;
* Possession of any item that can be used as a weapon, which may cause danger to others if used in a certain manner.
* Any other conduct which endangers the physical safety or bodily integrity of others.

Reporting Unacceptable Behavior
===============================

If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or harassment, notice that someone else is being subjected
to unacceptable behavior or harassment, or have any other concerns, please notify a Hack.lu organizer as soon as possible.
All reports are treated as confidential by default.

If the person accused of unacceptable behaviour or harassment is a member of the Hack.lu organizing team,
that individual is required by Hack.lu policy to recuse themselves from handling the complaint.

Hack.lu’s organizers will be available to help participants if they wish to contact
venue security or local law enforcement, to provide accompaniment, or otherwise assist
those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for the duration of the event.

You can report unacceptable behavior to any one of Hack.lu’s organizers or you can may email info@hack.lu, which is checked regularly throughout the event.

Further contact information is below.

Security Vulnerabilities Responsible Disclosure Policy
------------------------------------------------------

Hack.lu organizers take security issues very seriously and recognize the importance of preserving privacy
and security through a responsible disclosure policy. Any security vulnerability found related to the event should be disclosed in line with [CIRCL's Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure](https://circl.lu/pub/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure/)

Photography Policy
------------------

Hack.lu’s official photographers will be present during the event and will do their best in order to respect all requests by individuals not to be photographed.

Hack.lu reserves the right to publish pictures of the current and past event on the following platforms:

On our social media feeds (Twitter, Youtube).
On our Website (hack.lu).
In promotional materials about the event (event presentation slides, sponsorship packages).
It is not possible to always correctly identify specific individuals in a large crowd when on-site. However, anyone appearing in a photograph published by Hack.lu, who does not wish to be, can make a request to be made unidentifiable by writing to info@hack.lu.
Any attendee, organizer, volunteer, sponsor, or speaker who takes photos during the event is expected to abide by this policy if contacted by attendee.


Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
-------------------------------------

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant is determined to have engaged in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take actions to resolve the situation, including expulsion from Hack.lu and from future events without warning or refund.

Appropriate responses to unacceptable behaviour by the Hack.lu team will aim to mitigate harm which has occurred, to resolve conflict where appropriate, and to protect participants from future harm. Organizers may require an individual to pay for damaged equipment if applicable.
