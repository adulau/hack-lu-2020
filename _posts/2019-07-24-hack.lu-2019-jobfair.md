# Job Fair @ hack.lu 2019

![banner](/images/jobfair.png)

As Hack.lu is the biggest and most established technical information security conference in the benelux region,
it attracts a lot of highly technical attendees and some of them are looking for new challenges.

This is why we decided to give the opportunity to companies looking for such profiles to get in touch with them
during the conference.

The job fair will take place the 22nd of October, from 16:00 until 19:00, in the hotel of the conference, Parc Hotel in Luxembourg (Dommeldange). It is open for all candidates for free, only the [registration is required](https://www.jobfair.eden-forums.fr). 

Sponsors of the Cybersecurity Week Luxembourg and hack.lu have the opportunity to participate in the fair with a stand for free,
(within the limit of places available). If you want one, please get in touch as soon as possile.

Stay tuned on Twitter and during the conference for more details.
